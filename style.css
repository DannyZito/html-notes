If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:
<link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
First, add a <link> element within the <head> section then, add the href attribute to the <link> element and set it equal to style.css.
For example, in HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is <p>. The CSS syntax for selecting <p> elements is:
p {

}

Two curly braces follow immediately after the selector (an opening and closing brace, respectively).
Any CSS properties will go inside of the curly braces to style the selected elements.
To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the class's name.
Example, if the class is set to title, the CSS selector for it is .title
  <h1 class="title">Top Vacation Spots</h1> in html code will appear as
.title {
  color: teal;
}
in style.CSS
