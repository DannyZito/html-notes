	<h1>Basic Codeing Instructions</h1>
	You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.
	The declaration looks like this: <! DOCTYPE html>
	< !DOCTYPE html> must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.
	To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing < html> tags, like so: < !DOCTYPE html> < html> < / html>
	Anything between the opening < html> and closing </ html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.
	A html tag goes at the beginning and end of an < html> CODE, a < p> tag goes at the beginning and end of a PARAGRAPH.
	Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.  
	The opening and closing head tags &lthead&gt &lt/head&gt typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag.  
	The title can be specified directly inside of the (< head>) element, by using a &lttitle&gt tag. 
	Whitespace makes the code easier to read, example:
	</body>
	<p>Paragraph 1</p>
	<p>Paragraph 2</p>
	

	Comments begin with < !-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser.
	< h1> - used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings. Example: &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, &lth4&gt.
	The &ltem&gt tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
	The &ltstrong&gt will generally render as bold emphasis.
	To modify the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML's line break element: <br />
	
	<h2>LISTS</h2>
	
	<p>Unordered List Contains:</p>
	<ul>
	&ltul&gt
	<li>&ltli>Nacho&lt/li&gt</li>
	<li>Tortillas</li>
	<li>Chicken</li>
	&lt/ul&gt
	</ul>
	Ordered lists are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. You can create the ordered list with the &ltol&gt tag and then add individual list items to the list using &ltli&gt tags.
	<h2>IMAGES</h2>
	<p>The &ltimg&gt tag allows you to add an image to a web page. This is another example of a self-closing tag.
	src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image.
Example: < img src="image-location.com" />
    Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. 
	When you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image's description out loud to the visually impaired user.
	Using &ltimg src="link of the image" alt="A description of the image"/&gt we can add an image to the site like so:<img src="http://www.itsecurityguru.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bigstock-Hacker-Typing-On-A-Laptop-44548564-600x350.jpg" alt="Hacker" /> </p>
	Like the < img> tag, the < video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source.
	Unlike the < img> tag however, the < video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.
	&ltvideo src="link of video" width="320" height="240" controls&gt
    &lt/video&gt </p>
	<h2>ADDING LINKS</h2>
	<p>You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element &lta&gt and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.</p>
	<p>You must also add a href attribute like so;</p>
	&lta href="link to site"&gt description of link&lt/a&gt
	For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

&lta href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"&gtThe Brown Bear&lt/a&gt
	<p>A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full url, like www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby which is stored in a different folder). The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.

&lta href="./contact.html"&gtContact&lt/a&gt
	Linking to elements on the same page or to other pages on the same site is called navigation.
	HTML has a special tag called &ltnav&gt that is used to wrap these links in order to organize the content on your web page.
	<p> 
	Before displaying data, you must first create the table that will contain the data by using the &lttable> element.
&lttable>
&lt/table>
	The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: &lttr>.
	Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined.
	In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: &lttd>Number&lt/td>
	Table data doesn't make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.
	To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: &ltth>.
	Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:
	</p>
	<p>
row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
for example: &ltth scope="row">Name&lt/th>
	
	
    </body>
 </html>
