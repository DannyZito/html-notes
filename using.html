You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.
The declaration looks like this: <!DOCTYPE html>
<!DOCTYPE html> must be the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.
To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags, like so: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> </html>
Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code.
A html tag goes at the beginning and end of an <html> CODE, a <p> tag goes at the beginning and end of a PARAGRAPH.
Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.  
The opening and closing head tags (<head></head>) typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag.  
The title can be specified directly inside of the <head> element, by using a <title> tag.
